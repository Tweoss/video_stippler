# video_stippler

Incredibly simple version of stippling for an AP Lit self-introduction project. 

The algorithm for stippling splits the video into a grid and calculates the weight of each cell to determine the radius of the circle to be displayed. 

If there is only a small change in the circle raidus, then no DOM alterations are performed. Altering every circle on every frame resulted in the website crashing on mobile devices. Despite this lower "quality" performance optimization, we can still see the camera refocusing at times with all circles changing size. 

The instruments I play in the video are marimba (bass and chords), english horn (tenor), oboe (alto), and Apronus' [online piano](https://www.apronus.com/music/flashpiano.htm) (soprano). The melody is from Prokofiev's Romeo and Juliet, and my harmonization can be found at [this link](https://github.com/Tweoss/lilypond/blob/master/LilyPond%20Training.pdf).
